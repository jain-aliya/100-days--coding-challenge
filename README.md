# 100-days--coding-challenge
Day 1: Arrays – Reversing an Array
Problem Statement: Given an array A of size N, reverse the array in-place without using extra space.

Day 2: Basic Data Type
Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.

Day 3: 2D Array DS
Problem Statement:Given a 6 x 6 2D array,arr, an hourglass is a subset of values with indices falling in the following pattern.

Day 4:Dyanmic Array Problem Statement:
Declare a 2-dimensional array, arr, with n empty arrays, all zero-indexed. Declare an integer,last Answer, and initialize it to 0.

Day 5: Left rotation
Problem Statement:A Left rotation operation on a circular array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. The elements that fall off the left end reappear at the right end. Given an integer d , rotate the array that many steps to the left and return the result

Day 6: Digital Frequency:
Problem Statement:Given a string,s , consisting of alphabets and digits, find the frequency of each digit in the given string.

Day 7:String Similarity
Problem Statement:For two strings A and B, we define the similarity of the strings to be the length of the longest prefix common to both strings.

Day 8:Nth Term
Problem Statement:There is a series,s , where the next term is the sum of pervious three terms. Given the first three terms of the series,a , b, and c respectively, you have to output the nth term of the series using recursion

Day 9:Power Calculation
Problem Statement:Help Shashank in calculating the value of S, which is given as follows. Since the value of S can be very large, he only wants the last 2 digits of S .

Day 10:Permuting Two Arrays
Problem Statement:Complete the twoArrays function in the editor below. It should return a string, either YES or NO.

Day 11: Array Reversal
Problem Statement:Given an array, of size n, reverse it.

Day 12:Student Marks
Problem Statement:The array name,marks , works as a pointer which stores the base address of that array. In other words,marks contains the address where marks is stored in the memory.

Day 13:Bitwise Operator
Problem Statement:In this challenge, you will use logical bitwise operators. All data is stored in its binary representation. The logical operators, and C language, use 1 to represent true and 0 to represent false. The logical operators compare bits in two numbers and return true or false, 0 or 1 , for each bit compared.

Day 14:Array Manipulation
Problem Statement:Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each array element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.

Day 15:Mini Max Sum
Problem Statement:Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

Day 16: Time Conversion
Problem Statement:Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.
